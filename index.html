        <h2>Tonya Oliver: Excited to learn! </h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Tonya Oliver! 
            I was born and raised in London, ON.
            I am a mother! 
            My daughter is 10 years old and I couldn't be more proud!
            In my spare time I love doing anything creative.
            I make natural stone Jewelry and plan on using this course to further my design skills! </p>
