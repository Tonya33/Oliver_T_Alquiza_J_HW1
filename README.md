# Our new project

Hello! My name is Tonya Oliver! 
I was born and raised in London, ON.
I am a mother! 
My daughter is 10 years old and I couldn't be more proud!
In my spare time I love doing anything creative.
I make natural stone Jewelry and plan on using this course to further my design skills! 

I love walks and nature and love spending most of my time with my family
